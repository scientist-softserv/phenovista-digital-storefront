    <p>PhenoVista Biosciences, Inc. (“<b>PhenoVista</b>”) respects your privacy and is committed to collecting, maintaining, and using personal information about you responsibly. This Privacy Policy (this “<b>Policy</b>”) applies to all your use of www.PhenoVista.com (the “<b>Site</b>”) including services offered through the Site.</p>

    <p><b>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU WHEN YOU VISIT PHENOVISTA SITES</b></p>
    <p>Like many websites, our server logs capture the following internet or other electronic network activity information: information regarding PhenoVista Site users’ operating systems, browser software, IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, and the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstreams to, through and from the PhenoVista Site, including date and time. We may use this information to improve the services we provide through the PhenoVista Site, to monitor and improve the performance of our servers, to administer the PhenoVista Site, and to protect and defend our rights, property, or safety or that of our clients and other users of the PhenoVista Site.</p>

    <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
    <p>PhenoVista may use cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies to automatically collect this information. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device. By using the Site, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Site.</p>
    <p>Cookies are used to track your use of the Site. This enables us to understand how you use the Site and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve our website and services in response to what our visitors want and need. Cookies are also used to help us advertise jobs, products, or services to you that we think you will be interested in.</p>
    <p>Cookies are either session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. They usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page, but they do not collect any information from your computer. A persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer, and it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalization (see below).</p>
    <p>Cookies can also be categorized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Strictly necessary cookies</i>: These cookies are essential to enable you to use the Site effectively, such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on the Site cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</li>
      <li><i>Performance cookies</i>: These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our Site. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the Site are most popular.</li>
      <li><i>Functionality cookies</i>: These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymized.</li>
      <li><i>Personalization cookies</i>: These cookies help us to advertise details of potential services that we think may be of interest. These cookies are persistent (for as long as you are registered with us) and mean that when you log in or return to the website, you may see advertising for services that are similar to services that you have previously browsed.</li>
    </ul>
